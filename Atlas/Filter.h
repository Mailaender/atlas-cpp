/** Atlas stream filter

  Filters are used by Codec to transform the byte stream before transmission.
  The transform must be invertible; that is to say, encoding a string and then
  decoding it must result in the original string. Filters can be used for
  compression, encryption or performing checksums and other forms of
  transmission error detection. A compound filter can be created that acts like
  a single filter, allowing various filters to be chained together in useful
  ways such as compressing and then encrypting.
  
	Filters declare an instance of Filter::Factory in the module they are defined
	in. This allows them to be automatically included in the negotiation process
	that chooses which codecs and filters an Atlas connection will use. Each
	filter has metrics that allow Negotiate to make informed decisions when more
	than one filter is available for use. Currently these metrics consist of the
	type of the filter, whether it is for compression, encryption or check
	summing.
