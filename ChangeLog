	* src/*: Made code ISO 14882:1998 compliant from what I can
	tell. Compiles with CVS gcc now.

	* src/Codec.h: Applied template instantiation technique as
	mentioned in HACKING.

	* src/: Removed Filter and Filters/ completely.

	* src/Net/Stream.cpp: Removed references to Filter.

	* *.cpp: Removed .cpp files.
