TODO list for Atlas-C++

Items are in no particular order.

For 0.4.0:

 - finish tutorial/:
    * should we use libsocket++ or not? If we build our own, it needs
      to be standards compliant (sdt can help you with this)
 - write tests/:
    * definitely the biggest task
 - make all tests succeed:
    * goes together with the previous
 - update README
 - try to cut down compile time without affecting the API. Try to
   minimise #includes and use forward declarations in headers
   whereever possible (that actually reduces the _need_ to compile)
   (not sure how compile time itself could be reduced any further)

For 0.5.x:

 - rewrite the whole negotiation/Factory system. It's currently an
   awful mess.
