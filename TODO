TODO list for Atlas-C++

Items are in no particular order.

For 0.4.0:

 - finish tutorial/:
    * should we use libsocket++ or not? If we build our own, it needs
      to be standards compliant (sdt can help you with this)
    * should it be included in the top-level Makefile.am? Or should we
      just provide a regular Makefile (the latter might make it
      clearer how to use Atlas-C++) (not building the tutorial may be
      a good thing... maybe we could build the docs but move the
      example programs to a subdirectory of tutorial/... oh, what a
      good idea!)
 - write tests/:
    * definitely the biggest task
 - make all tests succeed:
    * goes together with the previous
 - update README
 - try to cut down compile time without affecting the API. Try to
   minimise #includes and use forward declarations in headers
   whereever possible (that actually reduces the _need_ to compile)
   (not sure how compile time itself could be reduced any further)
 - fix Factory on all supported compilers:
    * hard-code the list of codecs
    * make sure the factory list is instantiated
