TODO list for Atlas-C++

Items are in no particular order.

For 0.4.0:

 - finish tutorial/
 - write tests/
 - make all tests succeed
 - write filterbuf, which uses Filter to filter data passed to and from a
   streambuf (maybe) (will have to look into this - maybe Filters
   should be taken out of 0.4.0 completely and stabilised in 0.5.0)
 - make compilable on gcc 2.95.3
 - make compilable on gcc 3.0 (or current CVS)
 - make ISO/IEC 14882 conformant, with the exception of compiler
   kludges
 - make all template classes use format as documented in HACKING
 - remove .cpp files
