Read this carefully before working on Atlas-C++.

On writing templates:

 - put the declaration for the template class X in X.h
 - put the definitions for the template class X in X_impl.h
 - put any instantiations of X in X.cpp (or X.cc?), e.g.:
     template class X<int>;

This avoids duplicated instantiations and speeds up compile time.

On filenames:

In 0.4.0, C++ implementation filenames will end in .cc.
In 0.4.x, this may change to .cpp.

In 0.4.x:
 - files will have CapitalisedFilenames.extension
 - headers will end in .h

In 0.5.x and up:
 - C++ implementation filenames will end in .cpp
 - headers will end in .h
 - files may be lower cased. This is up to debate.
