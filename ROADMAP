Roadmap for Atlas-C++

There will be two branches. Linux version numbering will be applied.

0.3.9: A mess.

0.4.0: This version will be made from 0.3.9 and contains:
 - bugfixes
 - support for recent compilers:
    * gcc 2.95.2
    * gcc 2.95.3
    * gcc 3.0 [or latest CVS]
 - fully ISO/IEC 14882:1998 (the C++ standard) compliant code
 - a 99.9% stable API
 - no Filter support - there were various issues, and the API was too
   unstable (note that Filters didn't really ever work anyways!)
 - peace for the Atlas-C++ developers, at least
 - no Factory
0.4.1: 
 - a finished tutorial not depending on libsocket++
 - more bugfixes
 - a cleaner Net/Stream.cc
 - more platform support
 - no API changes
 - .cpp filenames
 - possibly a filter mechanism, if it has been proven very stable
 - more documentation
 - world peace

0.5.x: This is the playground, developed from 0.4.0. It shall contain:
 - Aloril's Objects/ changes
 - changes to the API
 - all fixes made in 0.4.0
 - filter support
 - some kind of "factory" mechanism
 - universal enlightenment

0.6.0: This will be the next stable version, with a fully stable API,
developed from 0.5.0.
