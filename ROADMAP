Roadmap for Atlas-C++

There will be two branches. Linux version numbering will be applied.

0.3.9: This is the current mess.

0.4.0: This version will be made from 0.3.9 and contains:
 - bugfixes
 - support for recent compilers:
    * gcc 2.95.2
    * gcc 2.95.3
    * gcc 3.0 [or latest CVS]
 - fully ISO/IEC 14882:1998 (the C++ standard) compliant code
 - a 99.9% stable API
 - no Filter support - there were various issues, and the API was too
   unstable (note that Filters didn't really ever work anyways!)

0.5.0: This is the playground. It shall contain:
 - Aloril's Objects/ changes
 - Changes to the API
 - All fixes made in 0.4.0
 - Filter support
0.5.0 will be developed from 0.4.0.

0.6.0: This will be the next stable version, with a fully stable API,
developed from 0.5.0.
