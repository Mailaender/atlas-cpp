Atlas-C++

Welcome to Atlas-C++, the C++ reference implementation of the Atlas protocol.

This library implements the Atlas protocol, for use in client-server
game applications.  This library is suitable for linking to either
clients or servers.

VERSION

This is Atlas-C++ 0.4.0, the latest stable incarnation of Atlas-C++ as
of 2001-01-24. The 0.4.x branch will contain NO API CHANGES. The 0.5.x
branch is completely experimental and may not be easy to track. Any
changes affecting the API should go into 0.5.x, as should any features
which are not completely stable. 0.6.0 will be the next stable branch.

* Any versions of gcc older than 2.95.2 are not supported! *

In order to generate the documentation, you will need doxygen.

This release should compile and work with:
 - gcc 2.95.2
 - gcc 2.95.3test2 and up
 - "gcc 2.96" from Red Hat 7 (make sure you have the latest update -
   packages aending in "-69" and above should work)
 - gcc 3.0 (this was not out at the time of release, but CVS gcc worked)

SOCKET LIBRARIES

Atlas-C++ relies on iostreams being used as socket streams for network
communications. This means you will need to either use an existing library
or use your own.

One such a library is libsocket++, which you can download at:

ftp://ftp.umsicht.fhg.de/pub/unix/language/C++/class-libraries/socket++-1.10.tar.gz

For a version that compiles in recent Linux versions:

http://3.141593.org/source/socket++-1.10-wf1.tar.gz

If you are using FreeBSD, please use the version in /usr/ports/net/.

We have not had the chance to test this in windows yet.

DOCUMENTATION

To generate the documentation, simply configure the tree, then in Atlas-C++/
type "make docs". This will use doxygen to generate the documentation, which
will then reside in Atlas-C++/doc/.

Please read the file HACKING carefully before working on Atlas-C++.
