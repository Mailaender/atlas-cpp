Atlas-C++

Welcome to Atlas-C++, the C++ reference implementation of the Atlas protocol.

This library implements the Atlas protocol, for use in client-server
game applications.  This library is suitable for linking to either
clients or servers.

VERSION

This is Atlas-C++ 0.4.5, the latest stable incarnation of Atlas-C++ as
of 2002-07-20. The 0.4.x branch will contain NO API CHANGES. The 0.5.x
branch is completely experimental and may not be easy to track. Any
changes affecting the API should go into 0.5.x, as should any features
which are not completely stable. 0.6.0 will be the next stable branch.

PREREQUISITES

Atlas-C++ has been compiled on a number of different compilers including:

Microsoft Visual C++
egcs 2.91.66
gcc 2.95.2
gcc 2.96 (provided many recent Redhat releases)
gcc 3.0
gcc 3.1

Previous versions of Atlas-C++ would not build on many compilers, including
specifically egcs and Visial C++. This is no longer true of this version.

COMPILING

For details of how to compile Atlas-C++ see INSTALL. Please note that
optimisation has been enabled by default for the Atlas-C++ build.
Atlas-C++ builds extremely slowly on some older compilers
if optimisation is enabled, and on such compilers it is recommended that
on slower systems binaries are built non-optimised.

To disable optimisation set the following environment variable before
running the configure script.

	CXXFLAGS=""

This overrides that default compiler flags, which include -O2.

SOCKET LIBRARIES

Atlas-C++ relies on iostreams being used as socket streams for network
communications. This means you will need to either use an existing library
or use your own.

One such a library is skstream, which is maintained by the worldforge
project, and can be downloaded from:

ftp://ftp.worldforge.org/pub/worldforge/libs/skstream/

This library works on many platforms including Windows, and is derived from
the FreeSockets library by Rafael Guterres Jeffman.

DOCUMENTATION

To generate the documentation, simply configure the tree, then in Atlas-C++/
type "make docs". This will use doxygen to generate the documentation, which
will then reside in Atlas-C++/doc/.

Please read the file HACKING carefully before working on Atlas-C++.
