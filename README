Atlas-C++

Welcome to Atlas-C++, the C++ reference implementation of the Atlas protocol.

This library implements the Atlas protocol, for use in client-server
game applications.  This library is suitable for linking to either
clients or servers.

VERSION

This is Atlas-C++ 0.4.3, the latest stable incarnation of Atlas-C++ as
of 2001-06-25. The 0.4.x branch will contain NO API CHANGES. The 0.5.x
branch is completely experimental and may not be easy to track. Any
changes affecting the API should go into 0.5.x, as should any features
which are not completely stable. 0.6.0 will be the next stable branch.

PREREQUISITES

Atlas-C++ has been compiled on a number of different compilers including:

Microsoft Visual C++
egcs 2.91.66
gcc 2.95.2
gcc 2.96 (provided with recent Redhat releases)

Previous versions of Atlas-C++ would not build on many compilers, including
specifically egcs and Visial C++. This is no longer true of this version.

COMPILING

For details of how to compile Atlas-C++ see INSTALL. Please note that
optimisation has been disabled by default for the Atlas-C++ build. This
has been done because Atlas-C++ build extremely slowly on some compilers
if optimisation is enabled. It is recommended that production binaries
and binaries for slower systems are built against an optimised build of
Atlas-C++. To enable optimisation comment out this line in configure.in:

	CXXFLAGS='-Wall -g'

as follows:

	# CXXFLAGS='-Wall -g'

and then re-create the configure script using the autogen.sh script. Note
that automake, autoconf and related tools will be required.

SOCKET LIBRARIES

Atlas-C++ relies on iostreams being used as socket streams for network
communications. This means you will need to either use an existing library
or use your own.

One such a library is libsocket++, which you can download at:

ftp://ftp.umsicht.fhg.de/pub/unix/language/C++/class-libraries/socket++-1.10.tar.gz

For a version that compiles in recent Linux versions:

http://3.141593.org/source/socket++-1.10-wf1.tar.gz

If you are using FreeBSD, please use the version in /usr/ports/net/.

We have not had the chance to test this in windows yet.

DOCUMENTATION

To generate the documentation, simply configure the tree, then in Atlas-C++/
type "make docs". This will use doxygen to generate the documentation, which
will then reside in Atlas-C++/doc/.

Please read the file HACKING carefully before working on Atlas-C++.
